What problem does it solve? -->\r\n<!--- If it fixes an open issue, please link to the issue here. -->\r\nAs highlighted in issue #259, changing the secondary headings to dropdowns will help the users navigate much easily.\r\n\r\nEarlier, the topics under the headings were stretched out and navigation involved a lot of scrolling.\r\n\r\nIssue #140 is the motivation for the second commit.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!--- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!--- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!--- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\nThis change was tested manually using the GitHub markdown previewer on Mozilla (on windows), Github android app and Brave browser (in android device).\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [x] Content Update (change which fixes an issue or updates an already existing submission)\r\n- [ ] New Article (change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Documentation change\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n<!--- Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. -->\r\n<!--- If you're unsure about any of these, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! -->\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n- [x] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** document.\r\n- [x] I have made checks to ensure URLs and other resources are valid\r\n",
